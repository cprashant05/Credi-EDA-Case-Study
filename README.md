Credit EDA Case Study

When a client applies for loan, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

Two types of risks are associated with the company’s decision:
 If the applicant is likely to repay the loan (Non- Defaulter), then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan(Defaulter), then approving the loan to such a client will lead to a financial loss for the company.

Our goal is to analyze the new and previous application data to study the pattern of defaulters (TARGET) and give recommendations based on
the observations which should help the company to make informed decision based on past data, and reduce the number of defaulters in future.
